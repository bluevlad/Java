<td style="padding-left:10px;font:tahoma;"><strong>Dear HMC Family</strong><br><br>

<strong>Congratulations for a HMC launching!  </strong><br><br>

<p>It is my great pleasure to announce an official launching of the HMC (HMC Cyber Academy) Website. <br>
HMC has spent many years to devise an effective training system. As HMC consolidates its position in a global automotive market, we realized that the training is as important as the number of vehicles sold in the market and the training needs to be systematically organized and centralized. Therefore, the HMC, HMC's new online training system, has been developed and now is just about to be introduced to our HMC family.</p>

<p>In the HMC, we offer four major training courses - Service Academy, Sales Academy, Technician Recognition Program, Parts Traning and Warranty Training. You can individually log on to the website and register and take relevant training courses and moreover, the courses are provided in several different languages for your convenience. </p>

<p>Although we are confident and excited about HMC's new global online training system, without your interest in and active communication within the HMC, it is difficult to expect a success of this website.<br> 
HMC is always open for you voice, if there needs to be improvement regarding the HMC. Please remember the HMC is a place where you can improve your business and technical skills. <br>
You have a full right to share your idea about the website. </p>

<p>Once again, I wish all the best for the HMC and look forward to the maximum use of this new online training website from our distributors and dealers. </p>
<br><br>
<strong>Best regards</strong></td>
