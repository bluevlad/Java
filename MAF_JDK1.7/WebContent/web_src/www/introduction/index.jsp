<p>It is a great pleasure to announce the official launch of the Hyundai Cyber Academy website.</p>
<p>HMC has spent many years devising an effective training system. As HMC consolidates its presence 
in the global automotive market with continuous sales growth, it is found to be more critical to 
have a systematically organized and centralized training system to support Hyundai’s local operations. </p>
<p>This new on-line training system has been developed and will soon be introduced to all Hyundai family around the globe.</p>

<p>HMC provides three major training programs: Sales Academy, Service Academy and Parts Academy. 
With these global programs, Hyundai Distributor’s training departments can use this 
Hyundai Cyber Academy website to register its local training, run the courses and even conduct 
on-line examinations. Hyundai Cyber Academy also provides a training records management 
function in multi-languages for your convenience.</p>

<p>Although we are excited and confident about this new global training system, a successful launch of 
this website will be difficult to achieve without your interest and active communication. HMC is 
always open to hear your voice and we encourage you to share your ideas and suggestions on this Hyundai Cyber Academy system with us.</p>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation and all the best for your business prosperity through enhanced training operations.</p>

<strong>Best regards</strong></td>
