<p>
It is with great pleasure that I announce the official launch of the KCA (Kia Cyber Academy) Website.<br/>
Kia has spent many years developing an effective training system. As Kia consolidates its position in<br/>
the global automotive market, we realized that training is as important as the number of vehicles sold<br/>
in the market. Training needs to be systematically organized and centralized. Therefore, the KCA,<br/>
Kia's new online training and management system, has been developed and is ready to be introduced<br/>
globally to our Kia family.</p>
<p>The KCA offers five major training courses - Sales Academy, Service Academy, Technician<br/>
Recognition Program, Technical Training and Warranty Training. The current contents will be<br/>
continuously updated and new contents will be added to improve the competency and skills of your<br/>
dealership personnel. By taking advantage of this website, you can have easy access to relevant<br/>
training courses. Moreover, the courses are provided in several different languages for your<br/>
convenience.</p>
<p>We are confident and excited about Kia's new global online training system, but it is difficult to achieve<br/>
success without your interest and active participation in the KCA. Kia is always open to your<br/>
suggestions, whenever a way to strengthen the KCA is found.<br/>
Once again, I wish you all the best with the KCA and I look forward to the maximum use of this new<br/>
online training website from our distributors and dealers.</p>

Best regards,</td>
